# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Block EC2 instance root SSH logon, or disable SSH logon altogether.
Block all ports to the internet in the EC2 instances. Only allow access via security groups.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, but it would make communication faster and cheaper, as the data travels on AWS own network.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, existing files will not be encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The changes would be overrun and the app would be back to its original state.
