Following are the security vulnerabilities:-

1. The use of a non-root account is not enforced.
2. The IAM password policy is not specified.
3. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
3. Loadbalancer does not have HTTP->HTTPS redirection
4. IAM policy  allowing '*' full administrative rights.
5. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation.
6. Process 'sshd' is listening on port 22 on the EC2 instance.
7. TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance.
8. S3 bucket logging not enabled.

recommendations:
1. Set IAM policies for not allowing root user and to enforce MFA.
2. Specify a more rigorous IAM password policy.
3. Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3.
4. Limit the traffic on the Loadbalancer, redirecting HTTP to HTTPS requests and also add default rule if rule doesnt match.
5. specify more granular IAM policy like what are the resources that will be accessing as well as the specific permissions.
6. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
7. Close port 22 and all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
8. Enable S3 bucket logging.
9. Enable WAF on Loadbalancer to terminate or prevent from malicious attack
